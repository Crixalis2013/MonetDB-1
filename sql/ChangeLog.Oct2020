# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

- CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER schema_name.trigger_name is now disallowed,
  because the trigger will be stored on the same schema as the table it
  refers to. Use a schema-qualified on the table reference (ie ON clause)
  when necessary.
